This work studies a deep metric learning method for compatibility learning, focusing on the fashion domain. We propose a notion of visual compatibility hierarchy, a training framework that learns in a ranking manner, and a data-driven method for learning such a hierarchy. Our method outperforms previously proposed approaches and enables our CNN to perform aesthetic/contextual compatibility classification, a challenging but unexplored task.> > Project Lead — Artificial Intelligence> Fall 2017* Led a team of 5 to deliver 3 month-long projects studying ArtificialIntelligence solutions for personalized tour guide systems, multi-robotpath planning in restaurants, and health monitoring for the elderly> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Face Similarity> Spring 2017* Description: In this work, we propose a new, subjective task of quantifying perceived face similarity between a pair of faces: Predicting similarity between facial images that are not of the same person. We present evidence that finding facial look-alikes and recognizing faces are two distinct tasks. Moreover, we propose a new dataset for facial similarity and introduce the Lookalike network, directed towards similar face classification, which outperforms the ad hoc usage of a face recognition network for the same task.* Published the paper "Finding your Lookalike: Measuring Face Similarity Rather than Face Identity" at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 2018> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Robust Automatic Poster Recognition (RAPR)> June 2016 - Feb 2017* Developed a robust algorithm to recognize occluded, text-heavy academic posters in real-life contexts using a deep convolutional neural network* Designed a method to automatically generate 2K synthetic training images for the network from a single picture of each poster* Trained the neural network using the dataset and achieved an accuracy of 92.8% for poster classification, outperforming traditional methods* Possible applications of this algorithm include, but not limited to, automatic electronic tour guides for research conferences and academic poster sessions* The paper for this research is available at thanhmvu.com/academia#rapr* Description: This work addresses a challenging but unexplored problem of image recognition: Academic poster recognition in conferences. We overcame the problems of posters' high text density and occlusions using an object detection CNN. Deviating from the traditional data-collecting process in deep learning, we instead automatically generated thousands of realistic synthetic training images. The network trained with our method outperformed traditional approaches with an accuracy of 92.8%.> > Research Assistant | Software Developer - Lafayette Information Technology Services> Bachmann House 3D Model> Fall 2015* Description: In this work, we preserved the 1753 Bachmann Publick House, Easton's oldest standing building, by LIDAR-scanning it and creating a web interface rendering 1.5 billions data points of a 3D model of the house using Potree, webGL, and Three.js.* Presented the interface at Undergraduate Research Conference in German Studies 2016> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Automatic Mobile Building Recognition (AMBR)> Summer 2015 (May - Aug)* Designed a real-time image retrieval algorithm for mobile devices using OpenCV, focusing on building and educational poster recognition* Improved the performance from 85.0% to 98.5% for building retrieval and from 92.0% to 98.5% for poster retrieval* Created an Android tour guide app implementing the algorithm* Published a paper at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) 2016* Description: This work presents an improved image retrieval method that can run completely offline in real time on mobile devices. Our algorithm successfully matched various objects to locally stored sample images with an improved accuracy of 98.5% in less than a second. Although this work focused on images of buildings and posters, the algorithm could potentially be used for other recognition tasks, with possible applications in electronic tour guides.SOFTWARE ENGINEERING--------------------> > Software Development Engineer Intern - Amazon> May 2017 - Aug 2017* Led the development of a project for Amazon Digital Book Store, which * * provides customers access to a larger number of relevant search results* * enables future integration of additional personalization features* * while reducing the number of users' clicks by 50%* * and having no negative effect on the search page latency* Collaborated with engineers, designers, and product managers from two different teams including Digital Store Experience and Personalization* The features have been fully launched on Amazon Kindle> > Project Lead - CS320: Database Management Systems> United Umbrella Project> Fall 2016* Led a team of four to create a web-based data management application for United Way of the Greater Lehigh Valley using PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, and D3.js* Processed the data and automated the loading procedure for more than 200,000 data points* Provided user-friendly interface, search tool, and various data visualizations* Our final product was ranked first among applications of 6 teams, exceeding the client’s expectations> > Project Lead - CS205: Software Engineering> Rocket Rapport Project> Spring 2016* Led a team of three programmers to implement a simple communication platform supporting blogging, tweeting, instant messaging, and group interaction * Created a user-centered software using MVC framework, providing both GUI and TextUI specifically designed for different types of users* Our final product was awarded as the best application out of 5 teams> > Research Assistant | Software Developer - Lafayette Information Technology Services> Bachmann House 3D Model> Fall 2015* Collaborated with Engineering and German Departments to build a web-based interface for the 1753 Bachmann Publick House, Easton's oldest standing building* Rendered 1.54 billion LIDAR-scanned points to create a 3D representation of the house using Potree, webGL, and Three.js* Presented the interface at the Undergraduate Research Conference inGerman Studies 2016TEACHING EXPERIENCE-------------------> > Teaching Assistant — Computer Science Department, Lafayette College> Spring 2017* TAed 2 weekly lab sessions (25 students each) for CS 150: Data Structures & Algorithms* Proctored tests and lab exams> > Teaching Assistant — Computer Science Department, Lafayette College> Spring 2016* TAed 4 weekly lab sessions (20 students each) for CS 104: Introduction to Game Programming* Proctored tests and lab exams> > Academic Tutor — ATTIC Tutoring Center, Lafayette College> Fall 2015 – May 2018 * CRLA Certified Tutor, Level I* Led weekly private tutoring sessions for individual students, covering materials in various Computer Science courses> > Drop-in Tutor — Computer Science Department, Lafayette College> Fall 2016 – May 2018 * Led 2-hour-long weekly drop-in sessions for CS.getHelp()* Assisting students from various courses, including Data Structures & Algorithms, Digital Media Computing, and Game Programming> > Calculus Cavalry Tutor — Mathematics Department, Lafayette College> Fall 2016 – May 2018* Conducted weekly drop-in sessions for Calculus Cavalry program to assist students from 5 Calculus coursesCAMPUS LEADERSHIP-----------------> > Co-founder, Vice President - Future Interactions Lab> 2016 - 2018* Leading a research group of students conducting independent research and projects, focusing on Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction * Aiming to create novel interfaces and introduce average students to the benefits of practical research through workshops, presentations, and hands-on experience* Working on semester-long, open-source projects, such as building a Smart Mirror prototype, and developing various iterative software> > Vice President, Tech staff, Treasurer - TEDxLafayetteCollege> 2015 - 2017* Led the club to produce more than 10 TEDx talks and multiple student conferences, drawing over 100,000 YouTube views* Reached out and collaborated with activists, artists, entrepreneurs, professors, alumni such as The Nerdwriter, Sebastiaan de With, Arvin La, ... as well as more than 20 student organizations and academic departments on campus to provoke meaningful ideas and discussions.* Recruiting and guiding new members, board members, and student speakers, inspiring them to bring forth and organize campus-wide independent projects, events and more.* Overseeing the preparation and operation of machinery and equipment, working with the tech team.* Being in charge of general finance, budgeting, fundraising, etc.HONORS------ > Phi Beta Kappa - "The Phi Beta Kappa Society is the oldest academic honor society in the United States.
