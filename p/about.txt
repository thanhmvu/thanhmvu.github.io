This work studies a deep metric learning method for compatibility learning, focusing on the fashion domain. We propose a notion of visual compatibility hierarchy, a training framework that learns in a ranking manner, and a data-driven method for learning such a hierarchy. Our method outperforms previously proposed approaches and enables our CNN to perform aesthetic/contextual compatibility classification, a challenging but unexplored task.> > Project Lead — Artificial Intelligence> Fall 2017* Led a team of 5 to deliver 3 month-long projects studying ArtificialIntelligence solutions for personalized tour guide systems, multi-robotpath planning in restaurants, and health monitoring for the elderly> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Face Similarity> Spring 2017* Description: In this work, we propose a new, subjective task of quantifying perceived face similarity between a pair of faces: Predicting similarity between facial images that are not of the same person. We present evidence that finding facial look-alikes and recognizing faces are two distinct tasks. Moreover, we propose a new dataset for facial similarity and introduce the Lookalike network, directed towards similar face classification, which outperforms the ad hoc usage of a face recognition network for the same task.* Published the paper "Finding your Lookalike: Measuring Face Similarity Rather than Face Identity" at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 2018> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Robust Automatic Poster Recognition (RAPR)> June 2016 - Feb 2017* Developed a robust algorithm to recognize occluded, text-heavy academic posters in real-life contexts using a deep convolutional neural network* Designed a method to automatically generate 2K synthetic training images for the network from a single picture of each poster* Trained the neural network using the dataset and achieved an accuracy of 92.8% for poster classification, outperforming traditional methods* Possible applications of this algorithm include, but not limited to, automatic electronic tour guides for research conferences and academic poster sessions* The paper for this research is available at thanhmvu.com/academia#rapr* Description: This work addresses a challenging but unexplored problem of image recognition: Academic poster recognition in conferences. We overcame the problems of posters' high text density and occlusions using an object detection CNN. Deviating from the traditional data-collecting process in deep learning, we instead automatically generated thousands of realistic synthetic training images. The network trained with our method outperformed traditional approaches with an accuracy of 92.8%.> > Research Assistant | Software Developer - Lafayette Information Technology Services> Bachmann House 3D Model> Fall 2015* Description: In this work, we preserved the 1753 Bachmann Publick House, Easton's oldest standing building, by LIDAR-scanning it and creating a web interface rendering 1.5 billions data points of a 3D model of the house using Potree, webGL, and Three.js.* Presented the interface at Undergraduate Research Conference in German Studies 2016> > Research Assistant - Computer Science Department> Automatic Mobile Building Recognition (AMBR)> Summer 2015 (May - Aug)* Designed a real-time image retrieval algorithm for mobile devices using OpenCV, focusing on building and educational poster recognition* Improved the performance from 85.0% to 98.5% for building retrieval and from 92.0% to 98.5% for poster retrieval* Created an Android tour guide app implementing the algorithm* Published a paper at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) 2016* Description: This work presents an improved image retrieval method that can run completely offline in real time on mobile devices. Our algorithm successfully matched various objects to locally stored sample images with an improved accuracy of 98.5% in less than a second. Although this work focused on images of buildings and posters, the algorithm could potentially be used for other recognition tasks, with possible applications in electronic tour guides.SOFTWARE ENGINEERING--------------------> > Software Development Engineer Intern -
