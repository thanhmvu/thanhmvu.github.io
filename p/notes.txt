Why Grad School?
---------------------
- To seek a richer and more satisfying life.
- To do research and push the boundary of human knowledge (by a tiny bit)
- To study Computer Vision and Machine Learning in depth
- To satisfy my love for computer science and visual art
- To have the opportunities to work in either the industry or academia
- To be able to work as a scientist in the industry and earn more money than I otherwise would have


How to search for papers of a research topic
---------------------
Idea: search for the most recent papers; they will cite past papers as well
- Identify keywords. Can look at wiki, google articles, lectures, etc to get a general idea
- If know conferences of this area/ domain, search for a list of papers for each year (starting from most recent conferences). Ctrl+f to search for keywords
- If already found some papers:
   + Look at previous papers mentioned in found papers
   + Search for papers that cite found papers
   + Look up authors of found papers. They are likely to have more works on the topic
- Google/ Google Scholar search for combination of keywords
